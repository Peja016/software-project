This was the first sprint, and because it was beginning it was the most important one. We got to know each other as a team, made a rough plan of the whole project and precise plan of Sprint 1, including plan for week 1 and week 2. 
	We successfully completed the basic targets, including software installation, defining user stories, mockups, and acceptance criteria, and implementing preliminary data scraping for bikes and weather.
	Besides that we did such things as: database design, setting up a tunnel to link the database from EC2, scraping bike data and weather data, writing the code to store the collected data in our database and started developing a homepage (still in process)
