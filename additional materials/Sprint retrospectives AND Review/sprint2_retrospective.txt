What went well:
1. Improved user stories and organized documents - Herman and team.
2. Completed the Flask app - All team members.
3. Decomposed front-end tasks and recorded them in the backlog - Kexun.
4. Worked on the front end, gathered feedback, and made revisions - Kexun and team.
5. Successfully obtained the Google Maps API, and each team member practiced accessing it - All team members.

What can be improved:
1.Avoid overplanning and overpromising, as it adds unnecessary pressure. Proceed step by step. We initially overplanned the website pages and interactivity but eventually focused on the essentials.
2.Collaboration is strong, but there’s room to improve efficiency. Over-collaboration can slow progress, so we should optimize collaboration time to enhance effectiveness.

Actionable improvements:
1.Adjust collaboration methods to balance efficiency. While feedback is important, over-collaboration should be avoided to prevent delays. Optimizing collaboration time will improve team performance.
2.Maintain daily communication and encourage team members to share challenges. Structured check-ins or more focused platforms may enhance collaboration.
3. Set deadlines with built-in redundancy to account for unexpected events from other subjects, ensuring project progress remains unaffected.

Team dynamics and wellbeing:
1.The team feels stressed due to other subjects, but the project workload is manageable. We’ll continue monitoring pace to maintain balance.
2.Improving efficiency and communication is crucial to meeting deadlines without compromising quality.
3.Despite stress, we continue to support each other, keeping morale high through open communication.
